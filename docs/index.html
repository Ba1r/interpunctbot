		<p>
			Inter·punct adds many things to discord. Some that should be in
			discord itself like
			<a href="#spacing channels">spaces in channel names</a>, [per-rank
			emojis], [pin messages to the bottom of a channel], [purge
			messages], [downloadable server message log], and other things like
			[customizeable quote lists], [auto-ban users with troll usernames
			(configurable, off by default)], [speedrun.com commands],
			[minesweeper game]
		</p>

		<h1 class="hc" id="spacing-channels">Spacing Channels</h1>

		<p>
			Inter·punct can be used to add spaces to channels. Use the command
			<code>ip!space channels</code> to replace all the dashes in channel
			names with spaces. Or, if you use underscores, use
			<code>ip!space channels `_`</code>.
		</p>

			Channels could not be given spaces. Maybe inter·punct does not have

		<p>
			This error occurs when there is a problem trying to edit channel
			names. Check the channel permissions and see if there are overrides
			set that prevent interpunct from managing these channels.

		<h3 id="spacing-channels-no-channels-help">
			There are no channels to put spaces in!
		</h3>

		<p>
			This error occurs when none of your channels have a dash in them.
			Inter·punct replaces dashes in channel names with spaces when using
			the space channels command. Add dashes to your channels and run the
			command again.

			Sending Messages to Multiple Channels

		<p>
			Inter·punct can be used to send a message to multiple channels at
			once. To do this, use the command
			<code
				>ip!send: <u>Your message goes here.</u>
				<a class="tag">#tag</a> <a class="tag">#some</a>
				<a class="tag">#channels</a> <a class="tag">#to</a>

			This error occurs when there is a problem trying to send messages.

		<h3 id="spacing-channels-no-channels-help">
			No channels were tagged!
		</h3>

		<p>
			This error occurs when you did not tag any channels in your message.
			To tag a channel, type <code>#</code> and then select the channel to
			tag from the list. You can start typing the name of the channel to
			select it faster.

		<h1 class="hc" id="lists">Quotes and Lists</h1>

		<p>
			Inter·punct can be used to add a custom random quotes command and
			other commands to your server. To use a list, use
			<code>ip!listname</code> and i·p will reply with a random quote from
			that list. Add a list using
			<code>ip!lists add <u>listname</u> <u>pastebin.com/url</u></code>
		</p>

		<h2 class="hc" id="lists-pastebin-format">Pastebin Format</h2>

		<p>
			Inter·punct uses a special format for lists in pastebin. You can see
			an example at
			<a href="https://pastebin.com/NFuKYjUN"
				>https://pastebin.com/NFuKYjUN</a
			>. Between each quote, put a blank line. To add an author to a
			quote, end it with <code>- author</code>. Quotes can span multiple
			lines.
