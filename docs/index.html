<p>
	Interpunct Bot can be used to add spaces to channels. Use the command
	<code>!space channels</code> to replace all the dashes in channel names with
	spaces. Or, if you use underscores, use <code>!space channels `_`</code>.

<h3 id="spacing-channels-manage-help">
	Channels could not be given spaces. Maybe interpunct does not have
	permission to Manage Channels?
</h3>

<p>
	This error occurs when there is a problem trying to edit channel names.
	Check the channel permissions and see if there are overrides set that
	prevent interpunct from managing these channels.
