{CmdSummary|ticket quickstart}

{Heading|Basic Setup}
To set up tickets, you need 1 empty category and optionally 1-3 channels for logging. Something like this:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/FZ9zOrP.png}

Configure the permissions of the category to not allow @everyone to view. Make sure {Interpunct} still has permission to view it though. Like this:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/IgmAku7.png}
You can also add in any additional permissions you need, for example if you want {Atmention|âœ…ï¸Ž Score Verifiers} to be allowed to help with tickets, also set:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/sVMfxgF.png}

Once you have the category set up, tell Interpunct about it.
{ExampleUserMessage|ticket category RANK REQUESTS}
If anything is wrong, {Interpunct} will tell you what needs changing.

Now, create an invitation message. Users will react to this message to create a ticket. Either send a message yourself, or use {Command|embed} to create a clean looking panel. Something like this:
{ExampleUserMessageNoPfx|{Blockquote|React ðŸ“¬ to request a rank.}
{Reaction|ðŸ“¬|1}}
Right click or Tap and Hold on the invitation message and select "Copy Message Link". Desktop screenshot:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/IXXmWvX.png}
Paste it like this:
{ExampleUserMessage|ticket invitation (paste)https://discordapp.com/channels/407693624374067201/413910491484913675/737920767559335976}
If anything is wrong, {Interpunct} will tell you what needs changing.

Tickets are set up. To try it out, click the reaction on your invitation message. If you haven't added one yet, add one and then click it after {Interpunct} replaces it.

{Heading|Ticket logs}
For logs like this:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/3S6YtZI.png}
you need 2 channels. The second one will have messages like this in it:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/8AdVa6k.png}
{ExampleUserMessage|ticket logs {Channel|ticket-logs} {Channel|uploads}}
Note that only the last 100 messages in a ticket will be logged.

For logs like this:
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/LtH2SvF.png}
you need just one channel.
{ExampleUserMessage|ticket transcripts {Channel|text-transcripts}}

{Heading|Additional configuration}

{Heading|Automatically close blank tickets}
{Blockquote|If someone makes a ticket but never sends anything, you can configure {Interpunct} to delete it automatically.
{ExampleUserMessage|ticket autoclose 15min}
Tickets where someone has sent a message will never be closed automatically.}

{Heading|Ping after someone types in a ticket}
{Blockquote|{ExampleUserMessage|ticket ping {Atmention|âœ…ï¸Ž Score Verifiers}}
{Screenshot|https://i.imgur.com/T1OTfUc.png}}

{Heading|Multiple ticket types}
